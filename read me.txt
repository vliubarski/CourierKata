brief comments :

- the input file is Items.xml where parcels/order details are stored; please use it for other test data;
- new (missing) calculation rules will be added in Main function when creating rule list for parcels / order; in this framework it will be very easy;
- all "magic numbers" related to business rules are used in CategoryDetails class where business rules are defined (except SpeedyShippingRule class);
- for the output ( IOrder/PriceDetails property ) normally separate class would be used but since it's fairly simple StringBuilder does the job;

thank you for having a look at this task and please contact me on 07957-445544 if any other comments are needed.

kind regards.
vitali.
